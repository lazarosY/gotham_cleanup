# gotham_cleanup

The entire explanation isn't particularly deep, I followed the instructions of the original repository : https://github.com/Konstantinos-10/UnitTestingPython/, and created a pytest test-suite that contains the necessary tests for the functions. I also added a pytest.yml file that automatically  runs these tests on every push through github actions.
